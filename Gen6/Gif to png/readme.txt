1. Extract all the files into a root directory which will serve as your conversion directory

2. Drag and drop your GIF files onto GIFConverter.exe to start conversion process. Multiple files can be dropped at once,
though too many files at once might cause the system to crash. (Max is about 325-350 at a time - mej71)

3. Enjoy your formatted PNGs! Don't forget to give credit.
