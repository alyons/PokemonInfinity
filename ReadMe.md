# Pokemon Infinity (Working Title? Series)

This is a fan game by PyroticBlaziken & RaynerWolf. We do not claim to own any of the copyrighted materials held in this game from Nintendo or Game Freak, we simply use them as a base to create an different experience.

This game is built using [RPG Maker XP](http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/programs/rpg-maker-xp). Unfortunately at this time, there is only a Windows version. We are thinking of moving to RPG Maker VX Ace Lite or MV (once it is released).

## Changes

A detailed list of all of the changes can be found [here](http://www.google.com/).

Our biggest goal was to make a more engaging experience for the player. We wanted to give the player more options; with things like a starter of each type, we figured we could let you get a good base for your team. Another thing we have done is looked at what Pokémon were just not good. We have used the tier list from Smogon to choose which Pokémon to improve and how we would go about balancing the game. We feel that you shouldn't feel like you have been limited by using a Fenniken on your team simply because there is no good way to use it's ability or that it's move pool or stats aren't that great. We also have made a few new abilities and attacks to add some diversity to the game, as well as have made changes to some of the old stuff.

I have always loved Pokémon since I was a child; it was the first game I owned for the Gameboy. With the fifth and sixth generations, I really came to enjoy competitive battling and felt that the games began to lose some of their luster, due to having such a low difficulty curve for the in game and then having to face VGC which is a format that is not really utilized within the game. I wanted to make a Pokémon fan game for a while, and seeing things like Pokémon Insurgence really drove me to try my hand at this. My biggest idea was to make sure that
